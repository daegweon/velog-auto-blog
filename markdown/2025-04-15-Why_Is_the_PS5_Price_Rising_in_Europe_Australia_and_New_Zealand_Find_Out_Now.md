# The PS5 Is Getting More Expensive in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, Again - IGN

Are you a gaming enthusiast eagerly waiting to get your hands on the highly anticipated PlayStation 5 (PS5)? Well, I have some bad news for those of you residing in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. According to a recent report by IGN, the PS5 is set to become even more expensive in these regions. As if the initial price tag wasn't steep enough, gamers in these areas will now have to shell out even more to experience the next generation of gaming. Let's delve into why this price hike is happening and how it may impact the gaming community.

## Understanding the Price Increase

So, why is the PS5 becoming more expensive in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand? One of the primary reasons cited for this price hike is the rise in production costs. The global supply chain has been severely impacted by the ongoing pandemic, leading to shortages and increasing costs for components. As a result, Sony has been forced to adjust the pricing of the PS5 to offset these additional expenses. This unfortunate reality may come as a disappointment to many gamers who were already grappling with the high cost of entry into the next-gen console market.

## Implications for Gamers

For gamers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, this price increase could have significant implications. Not only will it make the PS5 less accessible to some players, but it may also lead to a shift in consumer behavior. Some gamers may be deterred by the higher price point and opt to wait until prices come down or explore alternative gaming options. This, in turn, could impact sales figures for Sony and potentially alter the competitive landscape of the gaming industry in these regions. It's a challenging situation for all parties involved â€“ gamers, retailers, and console manufacturers.

## Coping Strategies

So, what can you do if you're a gamer in Europe, Australia, or New Zealand facing this price increase? Here are a few coping strategies to consider:

1. **Monitor Retailer Promotions**: Keep an eye out for special promotions, discounts, and bundles offered by retailers. You may be able to snag a deal that helps offset the increased cost of the PS5.
   
2. **Consider Second-hand Options**: While buying pre-owned consoles comes with its own set of risks, it could be a more affordable alternative for some gamers.

3. **Explore Subscription Services**: Subscription services like PlayStation Now or Xbox Game Pass offer a vast library of games for a monthly fee, providing a more budget-friendly gaming experience.

By adopting these strategies, you may be able to navigate the challenges posed by the rising cost of the PS5 and continue enjoying your favorite games without breaking the bank.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the news of the PS5 becoming more expensive in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand is undoubtedly disappointing for many gamers. However, it's essential to understand the underlying reasons behind this price increase and explore ways to cope with the changing dynamics of the gaming market. While the situation may be challenging, there are still options available for gamers to continue indulging in their passion for gaming without emptying their wallets.
