## FAA Emergency Order

In response to the fatal crash, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order grounding the New York City helicopter tour company involved in the incident. The order effectively suspended all flight operations of the company until further notice. This action underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need to prioritize safety in the aviation industry.

The FAA has also announced plans to conduct a thorough review of the company's operations, including its maintenance and safety practices. This regulatory scrutiny serves as a reminder of the critical role that oversight plays in ensuring the safety of air travel for passengers and crew alike.

## Safety Measures for Helicopter Tours

In light of this tragedy, it is essential for both companies and passengers to prioritize safety when it comes to helicopter tours. Here are some practical tips to consider:

1. **Research the Company**: Before booking a helicopter tour, do your due diligence and look into the company's safety record and reputation. Choose a company with a strong track record of compliance with safety regulations and a commitment to maintenance and training.
